# NSPanel - Setup for OpenHAB

This documentation describes the installation and configuration steps for how to flash a Sonoff NSPanel with Tasmota firmware and then to connect it to a OpenHAB3 system. The setup also assumes you would like to get weather information on the start panel. 
I’ve read (and reread) all the posts on this topic on the OpenHAB forum and my finding is that most people – just like me – get stuck on 1. Get NSPanel to ”talk” to OpenHAB and 2. Configuring the panels (screens) in NSPanel.

I will update the documentation as soon as I've learned and implemented or improved, but am doing this on my spare time so don't expect to much to fast.
